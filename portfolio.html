						<h2><a> Serverless Web Application of Sentiment Analysis on Texts </a></h2>

					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/Emmawang00/serverless_aws" class="image fit"><img
							src="/images/sentiment.jpg" title="source: Unsplash" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The project aims to build a serverless web application that is able to reuturn a sentiment report
						without a server, and perform Continuous Integration through Github Actions and configure Build
						Server to deploy changes on build (Continuous Delivery) using AWS Lambda, API Gateway and S3
						bucket. </p>

					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/Emmawang00/fastapi_news" class="image fit"><img
							src="images/fastapi_news.jpg" title="source: Unsplash" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The web application is built to return JSON payload containing the news that are relevant to
						what users want to read. Overall, it is developed using AWS cloud 9 as the environment and
						queries from the Atlantic news website. The microservice was containerized in AWS Elastic
						Container Registry (ECR) and pushed to production using AppRunner and FastAPI. Continuous
						Integration is enacted through Github Actions and Continuous Deployment is performed through
						configuring Build Server to deploy changes on build using AWS ECR and Code Build. </p>

						<h2><a> Personal Assistant Line Bot using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway </a></h2>

					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/Emmawang00/AWS_Line_bot" class="image fit"><img src="/images/LINE.png"
							title="source: newmobilelife" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The project aims to design an interactive Line Bot that can help track the to-do list. Line is a
						message platform where people in Taiwan, Japan and Korea use in their daily life. It deployed
						AWS Lambda Function that was built to connect dynamoDB (using boto3) and Line (using the
						line-bot-sdk). To establish the connection between users and channels,the Lambda Function was
						also connected with AWS Gateway using the REST API, which would allow the messages sent from
						Line users to store in dynamoDB, and allow the information to be pulled out from dynamoDB. </p>

						<h2><a>KPI analysis with MySQL Azure

					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/Emmawang00/SQL_KPI_analysis" class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL.jpg"
							title="source: Pexels" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The project aims to design an interactive queries function of SQL by connecting the database from
						Azure to evaluate the KPI performance.
						Local Database (DB) connection to Azure is executed by using Azure Database for MySQL single
						server(use Migration Wizard). In codespace, we can access Database which is exactly the same as
						the Azure database, and with this, I created a Datawarehouse and loaded all the needed data from
						the DB. Interactive queries can be perfromed in the codespace with the SQL interface. The goal
						of this project is to let KPI evaluation be more efficient and updatable by connecting to a
						cloud Database.</p>

						<h2><a>The Price Behind the Trends: Uncovering the Hidden Costs of Fashion</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/Emmawang00/clothes4good" class="image fit"><img
							src="images/cover_pic.png" title="Web App Page" alt="" /></a>
					<p>This HackDuke project aims to build an innovative and intuitive web app for sustainability
						fashion, which achieved a third-place in the environmental track. An image-to-text neural
						network model, natural language processing were adopted to help users identify the estimate
						hidden electricity, water, and CO2 costs of a piece of clothing by simply scanning the clothing
						label. The web app allows users to conceptualize the environmental impact of their clothing
						purchases, and stay informed when making purchase decisions. The app was deployed on Heroku and
						is currently paused due to high costs of running it.</p>

						<h2><a>Measuring the Effectiveness of Opioid Policy: A Causal Inference of Public Policy
								Impacts</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/Emmawang00/Diff_Diff_Analysis_Opioids" class="image fit"><img
							src="images/TX_death_diff.png" title="Analysis of diff-diff" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Using 400M+ rows of data, the project examines the effectiveness of interventions in the State‚Äôs
						Opioids policies in lowering the volume of opioids prescription and the rate of drug overdose
						mortality. Pre-Post analysis is first conducted to examine the difference in opioids
						prescription and mortality rate between pre-policy and post-policy era. However, even if the
						trend is different, we cannot be sure the difference is caused by the policy and not other
						factors. Thus, differnece-in-difference analysis is conducted. This method allows us to compare
						the change in opioids prescription and mortality rate in the state where the policy was enacted,
						with a hypothetical parallel universe where the policy was not enacted. Overall, the project
						provides evidence-based recommendations on the effectiveness of the State's Opioids policies,
						and to inform future policy decisions on opioid use and abuse.</p>

						<h2><a>BERT or Naive Bayes? Classification of LinkedIn Company Industry</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/Emmawang00/LinkedIn_Industry_Classification" class="image fit"><img
							src="/images/BERT.png" title="source: Devlin et al. (2018)" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The project aims to evaluate whether company descriptions on LinkedIn are
						sufficient to identify the type of business. The current study focuses on three predominant
						industries: Financial Services, Hospitals & Health Care, and IT Services & IT Consulting, while
						it can be scaled to incorporate additional business sectors for broader use
						cases. The study deploys BERT as a discrimitive model and Multinomial Naive Bayes model as a
						generative model to compare their effectiveness of classifying company's industry based on the
						company
						descriptions on LinkedIn. Synthetic data was also generated based on Naive Bayes model in order
						to assess how the two models perform under real conditions and under the conditions for which
						the generative method was designed. Results suggest Naive Bayes have a slightly better
						performance in classifying the company industry than BERT model, even though both achieved high
						accuracy. </p>
